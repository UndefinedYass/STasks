time for this
the STDS is the schema for (stasts doc) that are files that contain the tasks graph, they
besically define the semster and it's children, but they does not caontain the user progress
or any user-specific information (in fact the scheme itself can be user-specific but the point is that it's sharable amoung users while thing like progress information are not)
the STDSchema should be extandable in a backward-compatibility safe way, taht is to avoid data losse nd awkward data conversion in the future as the app grows bigger

the STDS is basic XML shema with a single root element: STDoc
when chosing the rrot elem i could have gone with SemesterDefinition
but then i realized a special root elemnt is more safe and can be suerd to save extra properties that has nothing to do with the semester such as the scheme version
the folowing are all basic elements that ar needed now to get the app working
sorted by parent to ascendant order
some element's serve as complex-type properties to theyr parents and are indented
STDoc
SemesterDefinition
 ClassesCollection
ClassDefinition
 SeriesCollection
SeriesDefinition
 ExercisesCollection
 TasksCollection
ExcerciseDefinition
 TasksCollection
Task

simple type properties that are needed (can be extandable under the same v1 as new features required)
STDoc: STDSVersion:i
SemesterDefinition: Name:s
ClassDefinition: Name:s, DeadlineDate:dt, 
SeriesDefinition: USI:s
ExcerciseDefinition: ExcerciseIndex:i, CustomName:s
Task: TaskIndex:i, CustomName:s, ID:guid

some propes are optional some are not, and some are mutually optional, if an XMLscheme was made i'l make sure to define the rules there

well i did watch SG last episodes yesterdar, that kinda counts

SO
now that i Restructured my dom objeects, implemented the ProgressObject base class that works sde by sde with STDOMObject,, got the dataService to work as needed, basic semester saving and serializng, it's time for the progress data now
ok the file will not only hold progress information but any future aditional data that is user specifc, from notes, completion dates, etc

that said, the file name should be the STDoc filename appended with .stud.xml (first file extension preserved)
STUD stands for user data

the parsing and serializing will rely on .net core utils, 
the class is STUserData, and it is semester-specific, it has a reference to one and only one semester name or id or hash
class: STSemesterUserData
   semester name:  referencing a semester name as in the semesterDefinition element, this is temporary unil adding a guid to the semester definition
   dictionary: task guid to boolean completion state
